What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

The assignment helped me understand pointer in C and the difference
between manipulating strings by incrementing an index and by 
incrementing the pointer directly. I got more familiar with the
the printf and fgets commands in C, and with standard input and output.
I also gained practice with header files and compiling executables
using multiple C files.

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No, because there is no way to determine whether the memory following
the end (NUll terminator) of the destination string is safe to override.
